# R-Copy

![R-copy](https://images2.imgbox.com/88/65/eAy1c0wr_o.png)

A very simple [Robocopy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/robocopy) GUI

## Background

Copying with CTRL-C + CTRL-V is fine with few files, but when it is a significant amount of files it can be... slow...

I therefor decided to create this simple application to ease the process for people who might not be very confident working with the command line, I am aware that there are other applications like this, but this was created to be as simple as possible with as few options as possible

## Installation / Usage

`! Only supported on Windows !`

This software is portable, so you can go to [the latest release](https://github.com/Loostie/R-Copy/releases/latest), download `R-Copy.zip`, extract and run it. **All the files in the zip needs to be extracted and in the same folder in order for the program to work**

Or you can download the solution and compile it yourself
